Explaination

`
jq is a command-line tool for parsing and manipulating JSON data. It allows you to extract specific fields from JSON objects, transform data, and format output.

In this example, the jq command is used to extract the name, resourceGroupName, location, and tags fields from the JSON output returned by the metadata service. The output is then formatted as a new JSON object with key-value pairs for each extracted field.

You can modify this command to extract other fields or add more fields to the output JSON object as needed.
